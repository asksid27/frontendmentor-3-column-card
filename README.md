## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used nth-of-type for the first time in designing. It is really useful to avoid redundant code.

```html
<div class="component">...</div>
```

```css
.component:nth-of-type(2) {
  background: var(--dark-cyan);
}
```
